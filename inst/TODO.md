# TODO - Road Map

## Unscheduled

Improve documentation of `weighted_line()`  and  `weighted_median_lines()`

Refactor C code:

* implement allocation of `struct` as compound literals
* check for null pointer return of `Calloc` 
* use `size_t` instead of `int` for size object (e.g., in for-loops or arrays)
* In C2x, `true` and `false` are standard types
